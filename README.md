# android_shopping_list
A simple shopping list application for android. It uses SQLite.
Note for creating SQLite:
Easiest way to create a SQLite data source for the code was for me to use the Firefox called "SQLite Manager".
Under Database menu in the editor, choose a new databse and then you can add tables to it. Very straightforward.
Basically, it creates a file for you.
